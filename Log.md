## Log - Round-1 30 Days of ML challenge :)


### Day 0 - Multi Linear Regression

After brushing up my basics on python and ML for almost 2 days, finally could start my journey on 30 Days for ML. The first problem (beginner's level) was related to Multilinear Regression available on link https://machinehack.com/practices/prediction-using-a-linear-model-fc54e/description. They had given the hint of using the predict() method of the Linear regression package in sklearn.linear_model. You can find my code on the link: where I have taken inputs from the user in the initial steps, then split the input into training and test sets (numpy arrays). Finally, I checked if the predicted values are same as the actual values for y in the test set. I split the dataset in the ratio 80:20. the prediction can change if this ratio is changed.


### Day 1 - Multi Linear Regression Coeffecient Determinant

The problem statement is to find the coeffecient Determinant for given values of X and y. I was confules with two formulae involved in calculating the coefficient of determinant, which is explained better in the read.me file https://github.com/AnaghaMulay/ThirtyDaysML/blob/main/Day_1_MultiLinear_Regression_Coeffecient_of_Determinant.md. However, I was able to clear my doubts when I read the formulae properly and also, the explaination on the function regressor.score(X,y) from sklearn.linear_models Linear regression package helped me understand more.


### Day 2 - Multi Linear Regression MSE, Coefficient and Intercept of Regression

The problem statement is to find the coeffecient and Intercept of Regression which are a part of the linear equation of the Regerssion and also find the Mean square error - how far the actual data points are from the predicted values. All are statistical measures and can be calculated using inbuilt function Linear Regression().
