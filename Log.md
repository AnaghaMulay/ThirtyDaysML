Log - Round-1 30 Days of ML challenge :)


Day 0 - Multi Linear Regression

After brushing up my basics on python and ML, Finally could start my journey on 30 Days for ML. The first problem (beginner's level) was related to Multilinear Regression available on link https://machinehack.com/practices/prediction-using-a-linear-model-fc54e/description. They had given the hint of using the predict() method of the Linear regression package in sklearn.linear_model. You can find my code on the link: where I have taken inputs from the user in the initial steps, then split the input into training and test sets (numpy arrays). Finally, I checked if the predicted values are same as the actual values for y in the test set. I split the dataset in the ratio 80:20. the prediction can change if this ratio is changed.
